# challenge-parallax

Created a simple js game. This is an infinite running game with obstacle. To jump over the obstacle, need to press arrow up key. The score is added automatically like timer. If it collides with the obstacle then game is over.

I need to improve the collision detection and need to add collision with the coins and add score.
